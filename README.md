# PolishOurPrices
Game prices in Polish currency (PLN) on Steam are currently one of the highest in the world, due to Valve's automatic exchange rate for PLN which is outdated and does not reflect curent purchasing power of Polish currency. There's an awareness campaign about unfair prices called #PolishOurPrices that already resulted in multiple indie devs lowering their unintentionally unfair prices of games such as Hades 2, No Rest for the Wicked, Selaco, Mullet Mad Jack, Into the Radius 2, Retropolis, Felvidek, Dusk, and many others. Adjusting game prices to the Polish purchasing power will encourage Polish gamers to buy games on Steam instead of buying it at a gray market key resellers or pirating it.
